            Spatikal is an online platform where we aim to provide vast
            information and insights on various topics. Our primary focus is on
            removing the digital garbage and bringing out a wider essence to the
            topic to which the audience can completely rely on.{" "}
            <p>
              Spatikal is derived from a Sanskrit word 'SPHATIKA’ which means
              ‘crystal’. A crystal is a representation of transparency and
              uniqueness which is what we aim on inculcating in our business
              model. We want to project transparency in the information &
              content we provide and uniqueness in the way we present it.
